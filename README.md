This repository contains an implementation of the word2vec model, utilizing negative sampling and undersampling, as it was used for a project in a Neural Networks class, along with a corpus-processing script and a script that runs the model on a hard-coded filepath to a corpus.

My gratitude goes to the teachers of the Stanford CS224n course, along which I developed the first, pure python implementation of the word2vec model, as well as Radim Řehůřek, creator of gensim, whose implementation my code approached as I worked on optimizing the model (the 'meat' of the training code as it is now almost equals the gensim implementation, and at its theoretical best performs equally well).
