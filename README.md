This repository contains an implementation of the word2vec model, utilizing negative sampling and undersampling, as it was used for a project in a Neural Networks class.

My gratitude goes to the teachers of the Stanford CS224n course, along which I developed the first, pure python implementation of the word2vec model, as well as Radim Řehůřek, creator of gensim, whose implementation my code approached as I worked on optimizing the model (the 'meat' of the training code as it is now almost equals the gensim implementation, and at its theoretical best performs equally well)

There is practically no reason to use this implementation when a library such as gensim is available. It is merely here for archive purposes.
